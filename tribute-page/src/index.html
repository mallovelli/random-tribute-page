      <h2>The life of Mr. Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
      <p> Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born on 15th October 1844 and died on the 25th of August 1900. He was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, writer, and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24. Nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life; he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897 and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche.</p>

  <h2>The philosopy of Nietzsche</h2>
  <p> There are many aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy it includes: Apollonian and Dionysian, Perspectivism, Slave revolt in morals, Death of God and nihilism, Will to power, Eternal return, Übermensch, Critique of mass culture. the most profound which has a huge relation to existentialism is the Übermensch philosophy. Übermensch(overman) is the ideal superior man of the future who could rise above conventional Christian morality to create and impose his own values, originally described by Nietzsche in Thus Spake Zarathustra (1883–5).</p>
  <h2> “God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”</h2>
  <p>The quote above might seem rather ridiculous or like ramblings of a mad man nevertheless it really did make a lot of sense. Though Nietzsche was critical of religion, his dramatic assertion that God is dead is not, as it is often interpreted as, a celebratory statement. Despite his reservations about Christianity, Nietzsche didn’t think the end of belief was anything to cheer about. Religious beliefs, while he thought them false, were very beneficial with helping us cope with the problems of life. Alcohol does not have this benefit, and it would not be at all surprising to Nietzsche that Alcoholics Anonymous meetings have Christianity and faith at the centre of their programs, and that this is often the most effective way to deal with alcoholism. Nietzsche felt that the gap left by religion should ideally be fit with culture: philosophy, art, music, literature etc. So the next time you go to get a drink, think to yourself, ‘What would Nietzsche do?’ and then go get yourself a glass of milk if you’re feeling special! </p>
